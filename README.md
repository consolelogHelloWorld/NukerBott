# NukerBott  
#### v0.1a

A simple (?) discord Nuker Bot made by Joee. In order to use this, you must know the basics of python, pip, and how to make a discord bot.  
This bot is written in python, and depends on the discord.py v2.0.0 or higher library.  

### Changelog:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

v0.1a
###### [+] Basic nuker command made.
- Deletes all channels.
- Creates {nuking-changelog, nuking-reason, dumbasses-complaining} channels.

###### [+] Stop command made.
- Forcibly closes all connections to discord. This means that to re-run the nuke command, you'll need to re-run the main.py.
